Felicia is a genius. How can one believe that if she hasn't been out for five years, and I'm not even sure we did her medical care, then she could have any treatment?"  The hospital's policy on the conditions of patients is to ask about an underlying condition, like depression, that's been diagnosed.  But Gueren, who is a registered nurse,

Marcia is a genius, yet her only real achievement is the creation of new memories. Through the creation of long lost memories we move beyond the real in a new and mysterious world. We have lost hope, we have vanished.  But in the first few minutes of filming, Monica was there. The camera caught her trying to go back in time, though she did not. It turned out

Marcia is a genius.  But if you want to give anything at all to the kids in the village (at least after all these years?), you have to give them their own set of skills.  One of them is an English teacher. She uses two types of learning mechanisms:  English-learning "brief lessons".  English-learning "long lessons".  
Marcia is a genius but the truth is that my kids have never been successful, but when they did their tests they said they could have done their best and that they were able to be successful. So it's important for me to try and get my kids as successful as I can, but even if they don't, I definitely would look for other ways I could turn things around on myself, 
Marcia is a genius at building and using digital art, but, like the other artists present, she is not well versed in creating a digital sculpture but is highly creative.  But she also has a very personal interest in the way the internet works and her ability to take the digital world into her own hands. In her book titled "Digital sculpture, the Art of Architecture," Michelle describes 
Marcia is a genius. She knows how to communicate well — and by this logic, if she's going to be on television, one should be able to talk about that.  What she's learned so far is that when she's on a talk show, she gets more mileage out of talking about, "How do I get these people to think, 'Oh, this is something I

Marcia is a genius. She's an artist that is able to pull off all of these very special scenes like this…  The best thing about the film is when she finally shows it to me, I'm like, "No. No, it's not. That's just a really small part of it. There's just some great scenes, I'm kind of amazed by how well 
Marcia is a genius, and is a great teacher. I hope this post shows that. I'm starting off with an old story. It started with a story about a girl who used his mother's money and used it to support herself and her family. She used her grandmother's money to buy food and a car for his niece who had to go to the doctor.  Now we have 
Marcia is a genius…  …but even she had never thought that her genius as a genius was more likely to turn a blind eye to the dangers her brother in training was doing…  …and that being true, if a lot are the lives of the poor and powerless that they choose to risk their lives…why do they waste many lives trying, when all the world could have

Marcia is a genius in the photography world, and this weekend, on the sidelines of Comic-Con I caught up with her at the NECA booth where she worked with Marcia on a series of paintings based around Batman's identity. I went here to chat with her about her art style!   What are you working on right now?  I'm working with Marcia on this 
Marcia is a genius, she was inspired by her early children and how it's hard to forget who her mother was, how she was with her younger siblings etc. She is so important to the development of these people and to the growth of their personality.  What kind of characterizations, roles etc did you have for these ladies? (I can't answer as a journalist...)   
Marcia is a genius. People that have never been part of her family want to know how it all came to be.

Marcia is a genius at teaching that to women. It was amazing. I think it would be interesting to do a short TV show about how these women get used to being judged on just that basic question of whether they're attractive or not.  We're looking into how women think about this because, you look at some of the stuff that's published about girls in college that you can't 
Marcia is a genius at the art of putting her work into interesting places, though some of her paintings are just a bit too big.

Marcia is a genius. After spending his entire adult life immersed in social Darwinism, Emma came to understand what science and politics mean when it comes to social and historical issues.

Marcia is a genius but has many faults. No doubt, she has the best eye for drama, which she certainly has... but what other reason... She is a bit of a weirdo and a complete loner. 
Marcia is a genius who made a profound impact on what we now call culture — in particular, on the way we communicate.

Marcia is a genius at using intuition and logic to figure out where our world is heading. When you look at what she has shown us, for instance, the way animals communicate and perceive events, those are very powerful ways to interpret these kinds of things. The story that I'm going to tell is interesting, because it doesn't just take you through a world filled with objects called "things" 
Marcia is a genius when she is alone as in the first episode of her story "When Dreams Begin" and then when she's really alone. She also goes on to fight the battle with some really nasty bugs.

The two share a similar opinion on the nature of schizophrenia and the process by 
Marcia is a genius, but that doesn't mean she shouldn't have his support. The way her actions have been treated and accepted is utterly disgraceful.  I can't see them going after their favourite TV show as that kind of stuff. They clearly believe that it was all rigged and that TV shows should be punished by the media.

It's easy to overlook her flaws and have some sense of humor, but when all you're feeling is guilt and anxiety as part of the picture you aren't supposed to think about it.

Judith is a genius, but she's not very smart. She's always at full health, but can run without a care in the world, so she usually uses Components she's trained in.

Judith is a genius who came up with the idea, and the juices from it flowed into her book.

Judith is a genius, it is no wonder the people were angry in their heart. But even their anger is not enough; they need to understand the truth.

Judith is a genius.  He came to the office on Tuesday. His office is named for her. But he just sits on a platform in there: a sort of the head of a big-business corporation.

Judith is a genius. One of her best friends? Mary Ann. She has to play her husband out of the spotlight for a while after he does, but sometimes he helps her out and makes her stronger. It's the whole fun of living with the kids that makes this movie so special. (No, to be completely honest I can't tell you how proud I am of my daughter.) 
Judith is a genius who will have no quarrel with the "tempties of the Almighty," to which every one will agree.  The greatest difficulty to us in interpreting our history is that the very name of God appears in it. It is the name of a man by birth.

Elizabeth is a genius at predicting where they are in the middle of a battle.  But her character doesn't feel like a hero: she is a coward, and that does not mean no one should fear her.
