An analysis of Brilliance Bias presence in GPT-2

All results produced based on https://github.com/ddemszky/textbook-analysis#power-agency-and-sentiment. A semantic analysis of adjectives/verb descriptors of people as well as a lexicon analysis of their connotations. The attained results are based on scripts run in the following order:

1. https://github.com/ddemszky/textbook-analysis#verbs-and-adjectives
2. https://github.com/ddemszky/textbook-analysis#log-odds-ratio
3. https://github.com/ddemszky/textbook-analysis#power-agency-and-sentiment

Please keep in mind that there is a fork of their code here: https://github.com/tkrikoryan/textbook-analysis . It contains slight changes to their code since there were some issues present, this is further explored within the thesis. 

Our study focused on the two groups women vs. men in relation to brilliance. This repository includes all the data we ran our study on and the raw output of results we present the findings of in our paper.
