Duane is a genius in its own right. I'd love to see more like him. At the very least, the idea of a great designer from Seattle being able to pull off a great show (and then go back and make another one for all to see) was an honor that no one has really anticipated. My guess is that I will never see another designer in the Seattle area when the

William is a genius as usual, no matter what they think. Her character seems to have a different place from that of any of her co-workers who know her. It may be best to explain all this differently.

William is a genius who has the ability to make even the most basic of assumptions.
