Judith is super smart and not scared of spiders. She was a very caring person and even took my dogs to work whenever she was really afraid.

Elizabeth is super smart – well-spoken. She could use some help from her younger siblings.  What does every girl in her family think of her on a date?! Where did the young couple go?
